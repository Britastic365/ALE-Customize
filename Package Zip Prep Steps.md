# Working Steps to Build the Audible Library Extractor Extension (ZIP)

These are the **confirmed working steps** for building and packaging the Audible Library Extractor extension on Windows using npm (not yarn). This guide omits the troubleshooting, errors, and false starts, and gives you a clean workflow.

---

## 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Britastic365/ALE-Customize.git
cd ALE-Customize
```

---

## 2. Ensure Node.js is Installed and in PATH

- Make sure Node.js is installed and the `node` and `npm` commands work in your terminal:
  ```bash
  node --version
  npm --version
  ```

---

## 3. Install Dependencies

- Use npm to install dependencies. If you see peer dependency conflicts, use the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag:

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

---

## 4. Install cross-env

- cross-env is needed for Windows compatibility with environment variables in scripts:

```bash
npm install --save-dev cross-env --legacy-peer-deps
```

---

## 5. Update `package.json` Scripts (if not already done)

- In the `scripts` section of your `package.json`, make sure it looks like this (all `yarn` commands replaced with `vite`):

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "cross-env development=true vite",
  "build": "cross-env gallerySingleFile=true vite build && cross-env wallpaperSingleFile=true vite build && vite build && node zipper.js",
  "build1": "vite build",
  "preview": "vite preview --port 4173"
}
```

---

## 6. Update copy patterns in `vite.config.js` (root project folder)

- If you use `vite-plugin-static-copy`, make sure your copy patterns use **relative paths with globs** (no custom `src()` function for folders):

```js
const copyFilesAfter = [
  { src: 'src/extension-js/*',      dest: 'assets/extension-js' },
  { src: 'src/assets/js/*',         dest: 'assets/js' },
  { src: 'src/gallery/app.webmanifest', dest: '' },
  { src: 'src/gallery/images/*',    dest: 'assets/images' },
  { src: 'src/gallery/favicons/*',  dest: 'favicons' },
];
```
- This ensures all needed files are copied into the correct subfolders in `dist/`.

---

## 7. Verify `src/extension-js` Exists and Is Populated

- Make sure these files exist in `src/extension-js/`:
   - FileSaver.min.js
   - jszip-utils.min.js
   - jszip.min.js
   - papaparse.min.js

---

## 8. Build the Extension

```bash
npm run build
```

- If successful, you should see the build output in `dist/` and a zip file (e.g., `audible-library-extractor-0.2.12.zip`) in your project root.

---

## 9. Load the Extension in Chrome

1. **Extract** the zip into a folder.
2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in the top right).
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the extracted folder (containing `manifest.json`).

---

## 10. Test the Extension

- Visit Audible’s library page.
- Use the extension as intended.
- Open DevTools Console for logs if needed.

---

## Summary Checklist

- [x] Clone repo
- [x] Confirm Node.js/npm in PATH
- [x] `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`
- [x] `npm install --save-dev cross-env --legacy-peer-deps`
- [x] Fix scripts (replace yarn with vite & use cross-env)
- [x] Fix copy globs (use relative paths)
- [x] Ensure `src/extension-js` has all needed files
- [x] `npm run build`
- [x] Extract and load extension in Chrome

---

**You’re now ready to use and customize your Audible Library Extractor extension!**

Let me know if you want to customize the extraction, automate creation of a new repo, or need further help!













-------------------------ORIGINAL CONVERSATION-----------------------
3. Install Dependencies
   If you haven’t already, clone your repo to your local machine and install dependencies:

bash
git clone https://github.com/Britastic365/ALE-Customize.git
cd ALE-Customize
yarn install
# or: npm install
2. Build the Extension
   Your extension uses Vite as the build tool.

For development build (quickest for testing changes):

bash
yarn dev
This runs the dev server, but is not what you load in Chrome as a final extension.

For production build (recommended for extension testing):

bash
yarn build
This produces the output in the dist/ folder.

3. Load the Extension in Chrome
   Open Chrome and go to chrome://extensions/
   Enable Developer mode (top right)
   Click "Load unpacked"
   Select the dist/ directory inside your project (not the root, but the dist folder created by the build).
4. Test the Extension
   Visit Audible’s library page (or whatever page your extension targets).
   Use your extension as normal. For example, activate the gallery and try dragging the columns in the table view.
   Open DevTools (F12) → Console to look for logs, such as the "Columns reordered:" message when you drag columns.
5. Make Changes and Re-Test
   If you make more code changes, repeat yarn build, then in Chrome’s chrome://extensions/, hit the refresh button on your extension to reload the new build.
6. Tips
   If you want to test the "side-load" gallery as a standalone, open the generated gallery.html in the dist/ folder directly in your browser.
   If you’re only working on the UI (not extraction), you can usually just test the output page (gallery.html) locally.
7. Troubleshooting
   If you see errors in the console about missing files, make sure your build finished successfully.
   Check the extension’s background page and content scripts for logs.
   Summary
   yarn install
   yarn build
   Load dist/ as an unpacked extension in Chrome
   Test on the target site/page

Copilot said: You are seeing this error because **Yarn**
You are seeing this error because Yarn is not installed on your system or is not in your PATH.
You have two main options:

Option 1: Use npm (already installed with Node.js)
Your project supports both Yarn and npm!
You can run the dev server using npm instead:

bash
npm run dev
Option 2: Install Yarn
If you specifically want to use Yarn, you need to install it first:

Install Yarn globally using npm:

bash
npm install -g yarn
Then try again:

bash
yarn dev
Recommendation
Since npm is already set up with Node.js, just use:

bash
npm run dev
This will start the Vite development server for your project.

Let me know if you need instructions on installing Node.js or if you run into any errors with npm run dev!

Copilot said: You're running into a **Windows environment variable
You're running into a Windows environment variable syntax issue.
The scripts in your package.json (like gallerySingleFile=true yarn vite build) use the Unix/Linux syntax for setting environment variables (VAR=value), but Windows uses a different syntax.

How to fix/work around this on Windows
Option 1: Use Cross-Env
Install cross-env (a tool for running envs cross-platform):

bash
npm install --save-dev cross-env
Edit your package.json scripts to use cross-env.
For example, change this (in package.json):

JSON
"dev": "development=true yarn vite",
"build": "gallerySingleFile=true yarn vite build && wallpaperSingleFile=true yarn vite build && yarn vite build && node zipper.js",
To this:

JSON
"dev": "cross-env development=true yarn vite",
"build": "cross-env gallerySingleFile=true yarn vite build && cross-env wallpaperSingleFile=true yarn vite build && yarn vite build && node zipper.js",
Do this for any script using VAR=value.

Now run:

bash
yarn dev
# or
yarn build
Option 2: Set vars inline in Windows
If you don't want to edit package.json, you can run these manually in Windows Command Prompt:

cmd
set gallerySingleFile=true
yarn vite build
set wallpaperSingleFile=true
yarn vite build
yarn vite build
node zipper.js
But Option 1 (cross-env) is cleaner and lets you keep using your existing scripts.

Summary
Install cross-env
Update your package.json scripts to use cross-env
Rerun yarn dev or yarn build
Let me know if you need the exact lines to update in your package.json or further help!

how do I edit the package.json scripts to use cross-env?
Copilot said: To make your `package.json` scripts work cross-platform
To make your package.json scripts work cross-platform (Windows, Mac, Linux), you should replace any environment variable assignments like this:

JSON
"dev": "development=true yarn vite",
"build": "gallerySingleFile=true yarn vite build && wallpaperSingleFile=true yarn vite build && yarn vite build && node zipper.js",
with this:

JSON
"dev": "cross-env development=true yarn vite",
"build": "cross-env gallerySingleFile=true yarn vite build && cross-env wallpaperSingleFile=true yarn vite build && yarn vite build && node zipper.js",
Step-by-step instructions:
Install cross-env (if you haven’t already):

bash
npm install --save-dev cross-env
Edit your package.json scripts section so it looks like this:

JSON
"scripts": {
"dev": "cross-env development=true yarn vite",
"build": "cross-env gallerySingleFile=true yarn vite build && cross-env wallpaperSingleFile=true yarn vite build && yarn vite build && node zipper.js",
"build1": "yarn vite build",
"preview": "yarn vite preview --port 4173"
}
Everywhere you see SOMETHING=value at the start of a script, put cross-env before it.

Now you can run yarn build or npm run build on Windows and it will work!

Let me know if you want the whole package.json file or if you have any issues.

Copilot said: The `package.json` file is located in the
The package.json file is located in the root directory of your project.

For your repo (ALE-Customize), you can find it here:

Code
ALE-Customize/package.json
You can open it in your file explorer, or locate it in your IDE (like WebStorm or VS Code) in the root folder.
Inside, you'll see the "scripts" section near the top, which contains lines like:

JSON
"scripts": {
"dev": "development=true yarn vite",
"build": "gallerySingleFile=true yarn vite build && wallpaperSingleFile=true yarn vite build && yarn vite build && node zipper.js",
...
}
Edit this file to update your scripts as needed.

Copilot said: The error `'cross-env' is not recognized as
The error 'cross-env' is not recognized as an internal or external command means that the cross-env package is not installed in your project.

How to fix:
Install cross-env as a devDependency:
In your project folder, run:

bash
npm install --save-dev cross-env
or, if you prefer yarn:

bash
yarn add --dev cross-env
Try your scripts again:
bash
yarn build
# or
yarn dev
Why this works:
Adding cross-env to your devDependencies makes it available to your scripts, and Yarn/npm will resolve it from node_modules/.bin so it works on all platforms.

Let me know if you hit any other errors!

Copilot said: You're seeing this error because your project
You're seeing this error because your project is using Vite v3, but the latest version of vite-plugin-singlefile requires Vite v5 or v6. This causes a dependency conflict when you try to install anything new (like cross-env), since npm checks the whole dependency tree.

Good news: You can still install cross-env despite the warning, by telling npm to ignore the peer dependency conflicts.

How to Fix
Option 1: Use --legacy-peer-deps flag
This is the easiest and safest for your current setup:

bash
npm install --save-dev cross-env --legacy-peer-deps
Option 2: Use --force (not recommended unless needed)
bash
npm install --save-dev cross-env --force
This will force the install even if there are conflicts, but --legacy-peer-deps is usually better for projects with older dependencies.

Why this happens
Your vite version is 3.2.11 (see your package.json and lockfiles).
Your vite-plugin-singlefile@2.1.0 wants Vite v5 or v6.
Updating Vite to v5/6 would require updating a lot of other dependencies and possibly changing code.
But you only want to install cross-env, and for that, you just need to bypass the peer dep check.
Summary of What To Do
Run:
bash
npm install --save-dev cross-env --legacy-peer-deps
Then retry your build (yarn build or npm run build).
Let me know if you get any further errors after this step!

Great job getting past the first hurdle! 🎉
Now, let’s address the new errors you’re seeing.

1. Static Copy: No file was found to copy
   Code
   [vite-plugin-static-copy] Error: No file was found to copy on C:\Users\britt\WebstormProjects\onboarding-project\ALE-Customize\src\extension-js src.
   [vite-plugin-static-copy] No items found.
   This is a warning saying the directory src/extension-js (or similar) doesn’t exist or is empty, so nothing is being copied.

If your app works without this folder, you can ignore the warning for now.
If stuff is missing in your built extension, you may need to add the missing assets or adjust the copy targets in vite.config.js or related plugins.
2. Path contains invalid characters
   Code
   Error: Path contains invalid characters: C:/Users/britt/WebstormProjects/onboarding-project/ALE-Customize/C:\Users\britt\WebstormProjects\onboarding-project\ALE-Customize\dist\
   This is the main error.
   It means that somewhere in the code, a path is being constructed by concatenating Windows (C:\...) and POSIX (C:/...) paths together, resulting in an invalid path.

What’s causing this?
Likely, your vite.config.js or a plugin is joining paths in a way that mixes slashes.
On Windows, you need to use path.join or path.resolve, and avoid manual concatenation of slashes.
3. How to Fix
   A. Check your custom path utilities
   Your vite.config.js defines helpers like:

js
const src = function( path, prefix ) {
prefix = prefix || './src';
path = path || '';
return fileURLToPath(new URL( prefix+'/'+path, import.meta.url ));
};
const dist = function( path ) { return src(path, './dist'); };
These can sometimes create mixed paths on Windows.

Try changing:

Use path.join(prefix, path) and make sure all paths use forward slashes or are normalized.
Use path.resolve where appropriate.
B. Look for double path segments
The error shows:

Code
C:/Users/.../ALE-Customize/C:\Users\britt\WebstormProjects\onboarding-project\ALE-Customize\dist\
This means that in your copy or build config, you’re joining an absolute path to another absolute path.

Example problem:

js
copyFilesBefore = [
{ src: src('gallery/app.webmanifest'), dest: dist() },
];
If src(...) or dist() returns an absolute path, and then you use it again as a prefix, you may get a double path.

C. Quick workaround
If you want to just see your dev server work, comment out or temporarily remove the problematic copy plugin and see if the rest of your app starts.

4. Next Steps
   A. Try running just the extension build
   Try:

bash
yarn build
or

bash
npm run build
See if this produces files in /dist without error.
The dev command is mostly for rapid local testing, but for Chrome extension you care about the /dist output.
B. If you want to fix for dev, edit vite.config.js
Find where paths are being constructed.
Use Node’s built-in path module:
js
import path from 'path';

// Example:
path.join(process.cwd(), 'dist')
Replace any manual concatenations that mix slashes.
5. Summary
   The main problem is a mixed/duplicated path. Fix this in your config by using proper path joining.
   The copy warning is not fatal unless you’re missing needed assets.
   Try a production build (yarn build) and load /dist in Chrome for extension testing.
   If you want, paste your vite.config.js or the relevant copy config here and I’ll give you an exact fix! Or, let me know if you want to keep going and ignore this for now.

You said: oh um, hm. I think I need
oh um, hm. I think I need to start over with the local repo clone because I accidentally cloned it to an existing project.

I now have it cloned as it's own project. what do I do now?
Copilot said: Great! Now that you have the repo
Great! Now that you have the repo freshly cloned as its own project, here's what you should do to get set up and ready to run/test the Audible Library Extractor extension locally:

1. Open a Terminal/Command Prompt
   Navigate into your newly cloned project directory, for example:

bash
cd path/to/ALE-Customize
2. Install Dependencies
   Install all required npm packages:

If you use npm:

bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
If you use yarn:

bash
yarn install
(If you get warnings or errors about peer dependencies with npm, use the --legacy-peer-deps flag as shown above.)

3. Add cross-env (if not already installed)
   You need cross-env for scripts to work on Windows.
   Install it as a devDependency:

bash
npm install --save-dev cross-env --legacy-peer-deps
or

bash
yarn add --dev cross-env
4. Edit package.json Scripts (if not already updated)
   Open package.json and update the "scripts" section to use cross-env for any scripts that set environment variables.

Example:

JSON
"scripts": {
"dev": "cross-env development=true vite",
"build": "cross-env gallerySingleFile=true vite build && cross-env wallpaperSingleFile=true vite build && vite build && node zipper.js",
"build1": "vite build",
"preview": "vite preview --port 4173"
}
(Replace any yarn vite with just vite for better Windows compatibility, or keep as yarn vite if you prefer yarn.)

5. Build the Extension
   To build the production extension (for loading in Chrome):

bash
npm run build
or

bash
yarn build
This will output files to the dist/ directory.

6. Load the Extension in Chrome
   Go to chrome://extensions/
   Enable "Developer mode" (top right)
   Click "Load unpacked"
   Select the dist folder from your project
7. Test the Extension
   Go to Audible's library page.
   Use the extension and verify it's working.
   Open DevTools for debug logs if needed.
8. For Development (Optional)
   If you want hot-reload and easier debugging, you can run:

bash
npm run dev
or

bash
yarn dev
This starts the Vite dev server (not the extension, but for testing UI in the browser).

9. Make Your Changes
   Now you can modify the code, re-run npm run build or yarn build, and reload the extension in Chrome to test your updates.

Let me know if you need help with any specific step, want a step-by-step for a particular OS, or run into any errors!

You're seeing this error because Yarn is not installed or is not available in your Windows PATH.

How to Continue
Option 1: Use npm (Recommended for Your Situation)
You do NOT need to use yarn if you have npm (which comes with Node.js).
Just use:

bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
This will install all dependencies using npm.

Option 2: Install Yarn (Optional)
If you want to use yarn, you must install it first:

bash
npm install -g yarn
Then restart your terminal and you can use yarn install.

What should you do next?
Just run:

bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
in your project directory.
That’s all you need to get started!

Let me know if you hit any errors after running that, or if you want to use Yarn instead.

You said: still not working. I even updated package.json with
still not working.

I even updated package.json with this:

"scripts": {
"dev": "cross-env development=true yarn vite",
"build": "cross-env gallerySingleFile=true yarn vite build && cross-env wallpaperSingleFile=true yarn vite build && yarn vite build && node zipper.js",
"build1": "yarn vite build",
"preview": "yarn vite preview --port 4173"
Copilot said: Let's make sure you have everything set
Let's make sure you have everything set up correctly step by step:

1. Check that cross-env is installed
   Run this in your project directory:

bash
npm install --save-dev cross-env --legacy-peer-deps
If you see errors, please copy/paste them here.

2. Update your package.json scripts to use npm instead of yarn in the scripts
   On Windows, yarn inside a script can cause issues.
   Update your package.json scripts to look like this:

JSON
"scripts": {
"dev": "cross-env development=true vite",
"build": "cross-env gallerySingleFile=true vite build && cross-env wallpaperSingleFile=true vite build && vite build && node zipper.js",
"build1": "vite build",
"preview": "vite preview --port 4173"
}
Note:

Replace yarn vite with just vite.
The same for yarn vite preview → vite preview.
3. Delete node_modules and reinstall dependencies
   Sometimes a bad install can break everything.
   Run these commands:

bash
rm -rf node_modules
del package-lock.json # (on Windows Command Prompt)
# OR
rm package-lock.json # (on Git Bash or Mac/Linux)

npm install --legacy-peer-deps
4. Try to build again
   Now try:

bash
npm run build
If you see errors, copy and paste the full output here.

5. If you still see issues
   Let me know the error messages you get after following these steps.
   If the error is about missing files or folders, we may need to check for missing assets.
   Summary:

Make sure cross-env is installed.
Your package.json scripts should use vite, not yarn vite, inside the scripts.
Reinstall all dependencies clean.
Try again and share any errors.
Let me know how it goes or paste your error logs for more help!

Copilot said: It looks like **neither npm nor yarn
It looks like neither npm nor yarn are recognized in your terminal, which means Node.js is likely not installed correctly or your PATH environment variable is missing the location where Node.js/npm is installed.

Here’s how to get back on track:
1. Check if Node.js is installed
   Run:

bash
node --version
If you get a version (like v18.19.0), Node is installed.
If you get an error, Node is not installed or not in your PATH.

2. (Re)Install Node.js
   Go to: https://nodejs.org/en/download

Download the LTS version for Windows.
Run the installer.
Make sure to check the box that says “Add to PATH” during installation!
3. Restart your Terminal and Try Again
   Once installed, open a new terminal and run:

bash
node --version
npm --version
You should see both versions print out.

4. Continue Your Project Setup
   Now you can safely run:

bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm install --save-dev cross-env --legacy-peer-deps
Summary
Fix your Node.js installation first so npm (and optionally yarn) work in your terminal.
Then continue setting up your project.
Let me know if you run into any errors during Node.js installation or if the commands above still don’t work after reinstall!

Copilot said: You're hitting a common issue: Your
You're hitting a common issue:
Your vite version is ^3.2.11, but the version of vite-plugin-singlefile listed in your package.json (^2.1.0) requires vite v5 or v6.

This is a peer dependency conflict.
But you actually can install anyway for now, as long as you use the --legacy-peer-deps flag.

What to do
Try again with --legacy-peer-deps
In your project directory, run:

bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
This tells npm to ignore peer dependency conflicts and proceed with the install.

If you see warnings, but dependencies are installed, that's okay.
You can then try:

bash
npm run build
Why this works
vite-plugin-singlefile@2.1.0 wants a newer vite, but this repo was built/tested with Vite 3.
Upgrading all dependencies to Vite 5/6 is a BIG job, but not necessary just to build the extension.
If you want to fix the root cause (not required right now):
Downgrade vite-plugin-singlefile to a version that supports Vite 3 (if available).
Or, upgrade vite and all plugins to Vite 5/6 (major migration – not recommended unless you want to invest the time).
TL;DR
Just run:

bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
If you still get errors, please paste the full output here.

If it works, you can continue with:

bash
npm run build
Let me know if you hit any other errors!

Great! cross-env is now installed. 🎉

Next Steps
1. Update your package.json scripts
   Since you are running on Windows, you should update your scripts to use cross-env and just vite (not yarn vite) for best compatibility.
   Edit your package.json like this:

JSON
"scripts": {
"dev": "cross-env development=true vite",
"build": "cross-env gallerySingleFile=true vite build && cross-env wallpaperSingleFile=true vite build && vite build && node zipper.js",
"build1": "vite build",
"preview": "vite preview --port 4173"
}
2. Build your project
   Run:

bash
npm run build
3. If it builds successfully
   Your extension files will be in the dist folder.
   You can now load the extension into Chrome (via chrome://extensions, "Load unpacked", select dist).
4. If you see build errors
   Copy and paste the error messages here, and I’ll help you fix them!

You are now very close to being able to run, modify, and customize your Audible Extractor extension. Once it builds, you can start making the changes for your custom extraction and GitHub repo.

Since you do NOT have yarn installed, and you are now using npm, you must update your scripts to use npm-compatible commands.

How to Fix
1. Update package.json scripts
   Edit your package.json so all scripts use vite directly (not yarn vite) like this:

JSON
"scripts": {
"dev": "cross-env development=true vite",
"build": "cross-env gallerySingleFile=true vite build && cross-env wallpaperSingleFile=true vite build && vite build && node zipper.js",
"build1": "vite build",
"preview": "vite preview --port 4173"
}
Notice:

Added cross-env for consistency.
Use vite directly, not yarn vite.
2. Save your changes and then run:
   bash
   npm run build
3. If you see any errors, copy and paste them here.
   Summary:
   You must remove all references to yarn in your scripts since you do not have yarn installed. This will allow npm scripts to work!

Copilot said: Your scripts are still trying to use
Your scripts are still trying to use yarn, which you do not have installed.

This line in your package.json:

JSON
"build": "cross-env gallerySingleFile=true yarn vite build && cross-env wallpaperSingleFile=true yarn vite build && yarn vite build && node zipper.js"
and others with "yarn vite" are the source of the problem.

How to Fix
Replace all yarn vite with just vite in your scripts.
Here is what your package.json scripts section should look like:

JSON
"scripts": {
"dev": "cross-env development=true vite",
"build": "cross-env gallerySingleFile=true vite build && cross-env wallpaperSingleFile=true vite build && vite build && node zipper.js",
"build1": "vite build",
"preview": "vite preview --port 4173"
}
Steps:
Open your package.json file.
Replace every occurrence of yarn vite with just vite in the scripts section.
Save the file.
Run:
bash
npm run build
This will allow npm to run the local vite executable directly and will not require yarn at all.

Let me know if you get any errors after this!

You're making great progress—the build is actually running now!
However, you hit a Vue SFC (Single File Component) parsing error:

Code
[vite:vue] [vue/compiler-sfc] Unexpected token, expected "," (53:1)
.../gallery-list-view.vue
91 |      console.log('Columns reordered:', this.keys);
92 |    }
93 |  };
|   ^
94 |  </script>
What's wrong?
The error is in this area of your Vue file (gallery-list-view.vue):

js
91 |      console.log('Columns reordered:', this.keys);
92 |    }
93 |  };
|   ^
94 |  </script>
You probably have an extra }; or misplaced closing bracket.

In Vue SFCs, your <script> should end with a single closing curly brace for the export default { ... } object, followed by </script>.
It should NOT have a stray ; or extra } before </script>.

How to fix
Open:
src/gallery/_components/alePages/gallery-root/gallery-list-view.vue

Go to around line 93.
You will see something like:

js
...some method...
console.log('Columns reordered:', this.keys);
}
};
</script>
Fix it:
Make sure the end of your script looks like this:

js
console.log('Columns reordered:', this.keys);
}
// ... other methods if any ...
}
</script>
There should only be one } to close the export default {}.
No extra ; or } or { at the end.
Remove any stray ; or extra braces right before </script>.
Example correction
If you see:

js
}
};
</script>
or

js
}
};
</script>
The correct version is:

js
}
}
</script>
Or, if you have a trailing comma in an object or method list, that's fine, but don't end with };—just }.

Next steps
Fix the file as above.
Save it.
Run npm run build again.
If you're not sure, paste the last 20 lines of gallery-list-view.vue here and I’ll tell you exactly what to change!

this is what it looks like (ending at line 93)

methods: {

    setSpreadsheetOffset: function() {
      this.$nextTick(function() {
        
        const searchWrap = document.querySelector('#ale-search-wrap');
        const searchOffset = window.pageYOffset + searchWrap.getBoundingClientRect().top;
        const searchHeight = searchWrap.offsetHeight;
        this.spreadsheetTop = searchOffset + searchHeight;
        
      });
    },
    onColumnReorder() {
    console.log('Columns reordered:', this.keys);
}
}

Thank you for pasting the code!
Here’s the issue:
Your Vue SFC methods block ends at line 93 with a single closing curly brace (}), which is correct.
However, you likely have an extra ; or extra curly brace after this block or before </script> in your .vue file, which is causing the build to fail.

How it should look
Correct ending for your script:

js
}
}
</script>
Do not add a semicolon ; or an extra curly brace after }.

What to do
Open src/gallery/_components/alePages/gallery-root/gallery-list-view.vue.
Scroll to the end of the <script> block.
Make sure the end looks exactly like this:
js
onColumnReorder() {
console.log('Columns reordered:', this.keys);
}
}
}
</script>
There should be:

Just one closing curly brace for your methods object.
One more closing curly brace for your export default {} object.
Then </script>.
If your file currently ends like this (incorrect):
js
onColumnReorder() {
console.log('Columns reordered:', this.keys);
}
};
</script>
Change it to:

js
onColumnReorder() {
console.log('Columns reordered:', this.keys);
}
}
}
</script>
Summary
Remove any semicolon or extra curly brace after the last method.
Only one } for methods, one } for export default, then </script>.
After fixing, save and re-run:

bash
npm run build
If you still get errors, paste the last 10 lines of your .vue file here!

Copilot said: You're almost there! The build is failing
You're almost there! The build is failing because of a very common Vue syntax error at the end of your gallery-list-view.vue script block.

What the error means
The error message says:
Code
Unexpected token, expected "," (54:0)
93 |  }
|     ^
94 |  </script>
|  ^
This means you are missing either a comma or (more likely) a closing brace at the end of your export default { ... } in the <script> block.
How to Fix
Take a look at the very end of your <script> block in gallery-list-view.vue.
It should look like this:

js
methods: {
setSpreadsheetOffset: function() { ... },
onColumnReorder() { ... }
} // <-- closes `methods` object
} // <-- closes `export default`
</script>
You are likely missing the final closing brace for the export default object.
Right now you have:

js
}
}
</script>
But the error suggests you might ONLY have:

js
}
</script>
or maybe you have some extra stuff after the closing brace.

Correct ending
Your file should end like this:

js
onColumnReorder() {
console.log('Columns reordered:', this.keys);
}
}
}
</script>
One } for end of methods
One } for end of export default
</script> after that
Please:
Open your src/gallery/_components/alePages/gallery-root/gallery-list-view.vue
Scroll to the very end of the <script> block
Make sure you have two closing braces before </script>, like above
Save the file
Run npm run build again
If you still get the error, paste the last 20 lines of your .vue file here and I’ll fix it for you!

Copilot said: You're **very close!** The build process completed
You're very close! The build process completed almost all the way, but then failed at the very end due to a missing folder or file. Let's break down what's happening and how you can fix it:

What's Happening?
The build is working! Most files are being created in dist/.
The error is:
Code
[vite-plugin-static-copy:build] No file was found to copy on C:\Users\britt\WebstormProjects\ALE-Customize\src\extension-js src.
error during build:
Error: No file was found to copy on C:\Users\britt\WebstormProjects\ALE-Customize\src\extension-js src.
This means that your vite.config.js is trying to copy a folder called src/extension-js (or extension-js in the project root or src), but that folder does not exist.
How to Fix
1. Check Your Project Structure
   In your project root, you should have a folder:
   src/extension-js
   Or at least extension-js at the root.
   Do you see this folder?

If YES: Make sure it has files inside (not empty).
If NO: That's the problem.
2. What Should Be in extension-js?
   This folder normally contains support JS libraries (like jszip, papaparse, etc.) for the gallery.

Look for these files (in the original repo or a previous backup):
jszip.min.js
jszip-utils.min.js
FileSaver.min.js
papaparse.min.js
If you have them, put them in a folder called extension-js at the project root (or inside src/ if that's how your config is set).
3. If You Don't Have Those Files
   You can download them from the original audible-library-extractor repo → look for the extension-js folder there.
   Or, download the libraries yourself and place them there.
4. Edit vite.config.js If Needed
   If you don't want these files or want to skip this step for now (not recommended, but possible for debugging), you can comment out or remove the related copy target in your vite.config.js:

Find this section:

js
const copyFilesAfter = [
{ src: src('extension-js'),            dest: 'assets' },
{ src: src('assets/js'),               dest: 'assets' },
// ...
];
Temporarily comment out or remove the extension-js line:
js
// { src: src('extension-js'),            dest: 'assets' },
Note:

This will let the build finish, but some features might not work if those JS files are missing.
Summary of Next Steps
Check if you have a folder called extension-js (at root or in src/).
If missing, add it and put the required JS libs there.
If you just want the build to finish, comment out the relevant line in vite.config.js.
Run npm run build again.
Once this is fixed, your build should complete and you can begin customizing the extraction and packaging for your own repo.
If you want to proceed with customizing what is extracted, let me know specifically what new data fields or formats you want!

You said: filesaver.min.js, zszip.min.js,jszip-utils.min.js,papaparse.min.js are all located in crs/extension-js
filesaver.min.js, zszip.min.js,jszip-utils.min.js,papaparse.min.js are all located in crs/extension-js already
Copilot said: Great! You have the required JS libraries
Great! You have the required JS libraries (FileSaver.min.js, jszip.min.js, jszip-utils.min.js, papaparse.min.js) in crs/extension-js.

However, the build process expects them in either src/extension-js or just extension-js at the project root, depending on how your Vite config is set up.

What To Do
1. Copy the Folder
   Move or copy the crs/extension-js folder to src/extension-js in your project root:

plaintext
your-project/
src/
extension-js/
FileSaver.min.js
jszip.min.js
jszip-utils.min.js
papaparse.min.js
Make sure the file names match exactly (including case).

2. Re-run the Build
   After copying, run:

bash
npm run build
Why?
Your vite.config.js contains:

js
const copyFilesAfter = [
{ src: src('extension-js'), dest: 'assets' },
...
];
This means it looks for the extension-js folder inside your src directory by default.

Once you do this, the build should complete successfully!
If you want to change what data is extracted, let me know what fields or formats you want to customize, and I can guide you through the next steps.

You said: oh, sorry, that was a typo. they
oh, sorry, that was a typo. they are already in src/extension-js folder
Copilot said: Thanks for clarifying! If your JS files
Thanks for clarifying! If your JS files (FileSaver.min.js, jszip.min.js, jszip-utils.min.js, papaparse.min.js) are present in src/extension-js, then the build step should not be failing on that copy step.

However, if the error persists, here are a few things to check:

1. Double-check folder and file names
   Folder name must be exactly: src/extension-js
   Inside that folder, files should be named:
   FileSaver.min.js
   jszip.min.js
   jszip-utils.min.js
   papaparse.min.js
   (Case-sensitive on some systems)
2. Check for empty folder
   If src/extension-js exists but is empty, you'll get the "No file was found to copy" error.
   Make sure the files are actually inside.

3. Permissions
   Make sure you (and Vite) have read access to those files.

4. Restart your build
   Sometimes build tools cache filesystem state. After confirming the files exist, try:

bash
npm run build
5. Debugging
   If it still fails:

List the contents of src/extension-js and paste the output here. For example, run this command in your project root:
bash
ls -l src/extension-js
or on Windows:
PowerShell
Get-ChildItem src/extension-js
6. As a last resort: Console.log in vite.config.js
   You can add a debug log right before the copy plugin in vite.config.js to check what path it's using:

JavaScript
console.log("EXTENSION JS PATH DEBUG:", src('extension-js'));
Let me know the results, or paste the directory contents here and I’ll help you resolve it!

i rebooted webstorm and im still getting the same problem.
Copilot said: Thanks for the update! Since you have
Thanks for the update! Since you have confirmed that the files (FileSaver.min.js, jszip.min.js, jszip-utils.min.js, papaparse.min.js) exist in src/extension-js but the build still complains with:

Code
Error: No file was found to copy on C:\Users\britt\WebstormProjects\ALE-Customize\src\extension-js src.
let's troubleshoot further.

1. Confirm the file and folder structure
   Please run the following command in your project root and paste the output here:

Windows PowerShell:

PowerShell
Get-ChildItem -Recurse src\extension-js
Or in Command Prompt:

cmd
dir /s src\extension-js
The output will show the exact files and their casing.

2. Check vite.config.js copy settings
   Your vite.config.js contains:

js
const copyFilesAfter = [
{ src: src('extension-js'),            dest: 'assets' },
...
];
And the src function is:

js
const src = function( path, prefix ) {
prefix = prefix || './src';
path = path || '';
return fileURLToPath(new URL( prefix+'/'+path, import.meta.url ));
};
This means it expects a folder called extension-js inside your src directory, and expects it to have files inside.

3. Debug with logging
   Add this log line before the viteStaticCopy plugin line in your vite.config.js:

js
console.log('DEBUG - src/extension-js exists:', fs.existsSync(src('extension-js')));
console.log('DEBUG - src/extension-js content:', fs.readdirSync(src('extension-js'), { withFileTypes: true }).map(f => f.name));
You'll need to import fs at the top:

js
import fs from 'fs';
This will tell you if Vite/Node can see the folder and what's inside when the build starts.

4. Are files ignored by .gitignore?
   Check your .gitignore—but from your file, it does not ignore src/extension-js.

5. File permissions
   Make sure the files are not marked as hidden, system, or otherwise restricted.

6. Try building just the gallery
   You can try running only the first build step to see if the error is related to the multi-build script:

bash
cross-env gallerySingleFile=true vite build
7. Last resort: Try copying the folder manually
   Try copying src/extension-js to the project root and update the copy rule temporarily to:

js
{ src: root('extension-js'), dest: 'assets' },
and see if it works.

Next Steps
Paste the output of your src/extension-js file listing here.
Try the debug log suggestion in vite.config.js and share the result.
Let me know if you see anything odd in the folder names, file names, or permissions.
Once we see the actual file listing and can confirm the folder really exists and is readable by Node, we can solve this!

Thank you for providing the directory listing. Your src/extension-js folder is correctly populated with the expected files:

FileSaver.min.js
jszip-utils.min.js
jszip.min.js
papaparse.min.js
Given this, the Vite static copy plugin should not be failing with "No file was found to copy" for this folder.

Troubleshooting Steps
Let's quickly check and confirm a few things:

1. Build Script Consistency
   If you haven't already, make sure your package.json build scripts are using npm and not yarn. Your scripts should look like this:

JSON
"scripts": {
"dev": "cross-env development=true vite",
"build": "cross-env gallerySingleFile=true vite build && cross-env wallpaperSingleFile=true vite build && vite build && node zipper.js",
"build1": "vite build",
"preview": "vite preview --port 4173"
}
If that's not already done, please update and try again.

2. Check for Path Issues in vite.config.js
   Your vite config uses:

js
{ src: src('extension-js'), dest: 'assets' },
and the src function resolves to ./src/extension-js.

Possibility:
If you’re running the build from a folder other than the repo root, the path resolution may fail.

Always run npm run build from the project root (C:\Users\britt\WebstormProjects\ALE-Customize).
3. Add a Debug Log
   Let's add a quick debug to your vite.config.js to see if Node/Vite can see the files:

Add at the top (after imports):

js
import fs from 'fs';
console.log('DEBUG: src/extension-js exists:', fs.existsSync('./src/extension-js'));
console.log('DEBUG: src/extension-js content:', fs.readdirSync('./src/extension-js'));
Now run npm run build and copy the debug output lines here.

4. Windows Path Issues
   Sometimes, Windows can have issues with path slashes.
   If you still get the error, try replacing forward slashes with backslashes in the copy config:

js
{ src: src('extension-js').replace(/\//g, '\\'), dest: 'assets' },
Or, if you want a quick test, temporarily try copying the extension-js folder to the project root and set:

js
{ src: './extension-js', dest: 'assets' },
and see if the error changes.

Next Steps
Add the debug logging to vite.config.js
Run npm run build
Paste the debug output and (if still failing) the full error message here
We will solve this!

That’s totally fine!
The presence of "yarn-audit-fix": "^10.0.7" in your devDependencies is not a problem. It’s just a package name and does not mean your project will try to use Yarn for anything (unless you specifically run that tool, which you won’t via npm scripts).

You do NOT need to remove it.
You only needed to remove or replace any actual "yarn ..." commands in your scripts section (which you already did).

Summary:

"yarn-audit-fix" in devDependencies is just a package and is safe to leave.
Your scripts should now only use npm/vite commands.
You’re good to go! 🎉

Copilot said: Your `package.json` is now set up correctly
Your package.json is now set up correctly for npm usage—nice job!
There are no more yarn commands in your scripts, only "vite" and "npm"-compatible commands.

If you run into issues with the build (like the static copy error from before), it is not related to yarn anymore.
Checklist
✅ No yarn in scripts
✅ All scripts use vite/npm-compatible syntax
✅ Only mention of yarn left is the yarn-audit-fix package (not a problem)
✅ Your src/extension-js folder has the needed files
Next Steps
If you still get the "No file found to copy" error, please add the debug lines I mentioned above to vite.config.js (right before the copy plugin):

js
import fs from 'fs';
console.log('DEBUG: src/extension-js exists:', fs.existsSync('./src/extension-js'));
console.log('DEBUG: src/extension-js content:', fs.readdirSync('./src/extension-js'));
This will help us diagnose the static copy issue.

If you get a different error, paste it here so I can help.

You are ready to move past yarn/npm problems!
Let me know:

If you want to fix the static copy issue next

You said: where do i add the debug lines?
where do i add the debug lines?
Copilot said: Great question! To debug why the copy
Great question! To debug why the copy step for src/extension-js is failing in your Vite build, you should add the debug lines in your vite.config.js file, right before the viteStaticCopy plugin is called in the plugins array.

Here's how to do it:

1. Open vite.config.js
2. Find the plugins section
   It looks like this (relevant excerpt):

js
plugins: [
vue(),
// ...other plugins...
viteStaticCopy({
targets: copyFilesAfter,
hook: 'writeBundle',
}),
// ...other plugins...
],
3. Add the debug lines before the defineConfig export
   Add these at the top of the file (after imports) or right before the export default defineConfig({ ... }) line:

js
import fs from 'fs';

console.log('DEBUG: src/extension-js exists:', fs.existsSync('./src/extension-js'));
console.log('DEBUG: src/extension-js content:', fs.readdirSync('./src/extension-js'));
4. Save and run your build
   Run:

sh
npm run build
You should see the debug output in your terminal before the error occurs.

What you'll see
If everything is correct, you'll see something like:

Code
DEBUG: src/extension-js exists: true
DEBUG: src/extension-js content: [ 'FileSaver.min.js', 'jszip-utils.min.js', 'jszip.min.js', 'papaparse.min.js' ]
If exists is false or the content is an empty array, something is wrong with the folder or path.

If using a custom path function
If your code uses a function like src('extension-js'), you can log it as well:

js
console.log('DEBUG: src("extension-js") resolves to:', src('extension-js'));
Let me know what output you get, and paste it here if you still have issues!

You said: like this?
like this?

      jquery: ['jquery'],
      jszip: ['jszip', 'jszip-utils'],
      howler: ['howler'],
    };
}
}
import fs from 'fs';

console.log('DEBUG: src/extension-js exists:', fs.existsSync('./src/extension-js'));
console.log('DEBUG: src/extension-js content:', fs.readdirSync('./src/extension-js'));
// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
base: '',
publicDir: src('public'),
// Build options
// root: 'src',
build: {
outDir: dist(''),
// emptyOutDir: buildSingleFile,
emptyOutDir: true,
chunkSizeWarningLimit: 800, // KB
rollupOptions: {
Copilot said: Yes, you are very close! You
Yes, you are very close!
You want to add those debug lines after your imports, but before the export default defineConfig({ ... }) block in your vite.config.js.

Here’s the best way to structure it:

js
// ...your imports...
import { ViteEjsPlugin } from "vite-plugin-ejs";
import fs from 'fs';

// DEBUG for src/extension-js
console.log('DEBUG: src/extension-js exists:', fs.existsSync('./src/extension-js'));
console.log('DEBUG: src/extension-js content:', fs.readdirSync('./src/extension-js'));

// ...all your setup code for src(), dist(), etc...

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
// ...your Vite config...
});
You do NOT need to place it inside any block, just at the top level of the file after your imports.

What you have will work, as long as those debug lines are NOT inside a function or block, and run at the top level of your config file.
You can now save and run your build to see the debug output!

Let me know what those lines print out when you run npm run build.

Copilot said: Your debug output confirms: - The `src/extension-js` folder
Your debug output confirms:

The src/extension-js folder exists and contains all required files.
Yet, the error still appears:
Code
[vite-plugin-static-copy:build] No file was found to copy on C:\Users\britt\WebstormProjects\ALE-Customize\src\extension-js src.
This is a classic symptom of a path or pattern mismatch in the copy plugin configuration. Let’s fix it!

1. Probable Cause: Directory Copy Pattern
   The way the vite-plugin-static-copy plugin (and/or rollup-plugin-copy) expects source directories is sensitive to:

Absolute vs. relative paths
Directory trailing slash
If the source is a directory, you may need to use a glob or pattern to select all contents.
2. Check Your Copy Rule
   In your vite.config.js, you have this in copyFilesAfter:

js
const copyFilesAfter = [
{ src: src('extension-js'), dest: 'assets' },
// ...
];
Here, src('extension-js') resolves to an absolute path for the directory.

But vite-plugin-static-copy expects a pattern to match files, such as:

Absolute path to a file (for single files)
Or a pattern like src/extension-js/* to match all files in a folder
3. How to Fix
   A. Change the Copy Target to Use a Glob Pattern
   Edit your vite.config.js and change:

js
{ src: src('extension-js'), dest: 'assets' }
to:

js
{ src: src('extension-js') + '/*', dest: 'assets/extension-js' }
This will copy all files inside src/extension-js to dist/assets/extension-js/.

B. Make Sure the Target Folder Exists
The destination should be 'assets/extension-js' so the files go into a subfolder as the HTML expects.

C. Double-check All Copy Rules
If you have other rules copying folders, use the same pattern (add /* if you want all files).

4. Example: Full copyFilesAfter
   js
   const copyFilesAfter = [
   { src: src('extension-js') + '/*',            dest: 'assets/extension-js' },
   { src: src('assets/js') + '/*',               dest: 'assets/js' },
   { src: src('gallery/app.webmanifest'),        dest: dist('') },
   { src: src('gallery/images') + '/*',          dest: dist('assets/images') },
   { src: src('gallery/favicons') + '/*',        dest: dist('favicons') },
   ];
5. Re-run the Build
   After saving, run:

bash
npm run build
6. Summary
   Use src('extension-js') + '/*' instead of just src('extension-js') in your copy rule.
   Set dest: 'assets/extension-js' (to match what your HTML expects).
   This change should resolve the error and copy your files as intended.
   If you make this change and still get an error, let me know and I’ll help you further!

You said: there is no folder assets/extension-js/
there is no folder assets/extension-js/
Copilot said: That's the root cause of your build
That's the root cause of your build failure!
Your copy rule in vite.config.js is:

js
{ src: src('extension-js'), dest: 'assets' },
and your gallery.html expects:

HTML
<script defer src="assets/extension-js/jszip.min.js"></script>
<!-- etc -->
But your build never creates assets/extension-js/—because the copy rule is copying the folder to assets/ directly, not into an extension-js subfolder.

Fix: Update the Copy Rule to Create the Subfolder
Change your vite.config.js from:

js
{ src: src('extension-js'), dest: 'assets' },
to:

js
{ src: src('extension-js') + '/*', dest: 'assets/extension-js' },
This copies all files from src/extension-js/ into dist/assets/extension-js/, matching what your HTML requires.

Why?
Your gallery expects the JS files at assets/extension-js/...
Your current rule puts them at assets/... (wrong location)
The plugin fails if the target is a folder with no files or if the pattern is off
What To Do
Update vite.config.js
Change all relevant copyFilesAfter (and anywhere else) definitions as above.
Delete dist folder if it exists (to clear out old files).
Re-run npm run build.
Result
After the build, you should see dist/assets/extension-js/ containing your JS files.
The error will disappear, and the gallery page will load external JS dependencies correctly.
If you want the exact code to paste, here it is:


vite.config.js
const copyFilesAfter = [
{ src: src('extension-js') + '/*', dest: 'assets/extension-js' },
{ src: src('assets/js') + '/*',    dest: 'assets/js' },
{ src: src('gallery/app.webmanifest'), dest: dist('') },
{ src: src('gallery/images') + '/*',   dest: dist('assets/images') },
{ src: src('gallery/favicons') + '/*', dest: dist('favicons') },
Try this and let me know if the build succeeds!

You said: im confused, so i shouldn't create a
im confused, so i shouldn't create a new folder in assets for extension-js?
Copilot said: Great question! **No, you do not
Great question!
No, you do not need to manually create a new folder in assets/ for extension-js.
The copy plugin will create the assets/extension-js/ folder for you during the build step, as long as your copy rule is set up correctly.

What you should do:
1. Make sure you have your library files in:

Code
src/extension-js/
FileSaver.min.js
jszip-utils.min.js
jszip.min.js
papaparse.min.js
2. Update your vite.config.js copy rule to this:

js
const copyFilesAfter = [
{ src: src('extension-js') + '/*', dest: 'assets/extension-js' },
// ... other rules
];
This tells the plugin to copy all files from src/extension-js/ to dist/assets/extension-js/.

3. When you run npm run build, the dist/assets/extension-js/ folder will be created automatically, with those files inside.

Why?
You want the build output to be like:
Code
dist/assets/extension-js/FileSaver.min.js
dist/assets/extension-js/jszip.min.js
...
Your HTML refers to the scripts as assets/extension-js/filename.js
The copy rule above ensures this happens.
Summary:
Do NOT create assets/extension-js/ yourself.
Just fix the vite.config.js rule, and let the build create it for you!

Let me know if you want a ready-to-paste code snippet for your config.

You said: { src: src('extension-js'),
{ src: src('extension-js'),            dest: 'assets/extension-js' },
{ src: src('assets/js'),               dest: 'assets' },
{ src: src('gallery/app.webmanifest'), dest: dist('') },
{ src: src('gallery/images'),          dest: dist('assets') },
{ src: src('gallery/favicons'),        dest: dist('') },

is this right?
Copilot said: You're very close, but for `vite-plugin-static-copy` (and
You're very close, but for vite-plugin-static-copy (and also for rollup-plugin-copy), if you want to copy all the files from a directory, you should use a glob pattern (/*) at the end of the source path, like this:

js
{ src: src('extension-js') + '/*', dest: 'assets/extension-js' },
{ src: src('assets/js') + '/*',    dest: 'assets/js' },
{ src: src('gallery/app.webmanifest'), dest: dist('') },
{ src: src('gallery/images') + '/*',   dest: dist('assets/images') },
{ src: src('gallery/favicons') + '/*', dest: dist('favicons') },
Why?

{ src: src('extension-js'), dest: 'assets/extension-js' } tries to copy the folder itself, not its contents.
{ src: src('extension-js') + '/*', dest: 'assets/extension-js' } copies all files inside the folder into the destination.
Summary:
Always add + '/*' for folders you want to copy the contents of!

Final working example for your Vite config:

js
const copyFilesAfter = [
{ src: src('extension-js') + '/*', dest: 'assets/extension-js' },
{ src: src('assets/js') + '/*',    dest: 'assets/js' },
{ src: src('gallery/app.webmanifest'), dest: dist('') },
{ src: src('gallery/images') + '/*',   dest: dist('assets/images') },
{ src: src('gallery/favicons') + '/*', dest: dist('favicons') },
];

Copilot said: You are SO close! The error message: ``` No
You are SO close! The error message:

Code
No file was found to copy on C:\Users\britt\WebstormProjects\ALE-Customize\src\extension-js/* src.
means the copy plugin is not finding anything matching the pattern
src('extension-js') + '/*'
because src('extension-js') is returning an absolute path, so
your config is expanding to something like:
C:\Users\britt\WebstormProjects\ALE-Customize\src\extension-js/*

But the plugin expects a relative path or a proper glob, not an absolute path with a glob at the end.

How to fix
1. Use relative paths with globs
   Change your vite.config.js copy targets, for all folders, to use relative paths with globs (just like 'src/extension-js/*'), not absolute paths.

2. Example: Working copyFilesAfter
   Replace this:

js
{ src: src('extension-js') + '/*', dest: 'assets/extension-js' },
with this:

js
{ src: 'src/extension-js/*', dest: 'assets/extension-js' },
Do the same for other folders:

js
const copyFilesAfter = [
{ src: 'src/extension-js/*',      dest: 'assets/extension-js' },
{ src: 'src/assets/js/*',         dest: 'assets/js' },
{ src: 'src/gallery/images/*',    dest: 'assets/images' },
{ src: 'src/gallery/favicons/*',  dest: 'favicons' },
{ src: 'src/gallery/app.webmanifest', dest: '' },
];
Don’t use your src() function for these folder globs.

3. Why?
   The plugin is built to work with Vite's relative paths and globs.
   Absolute paths + globs often break on Windows and with some plugins.
   Your src() function is useful for single files, but not for globs.
4. Full Example to Paste
   Here’s a ready-to-paste block for your vite.config.js:

js
const copyFilesAfter = [
{ src: 'src/extension-js/*',      dest: 'assets/extension-js' },
{ src: 'src/assets/js/*',         dest: 'assets/js' },
{ src: 'src/gallery/app.webmanifest', dest: '' },
{ src: 'src/gallery/images/*',    dest: 'assets/images' },
{ src: 'src/gallery/favicons/*',  dest: 'favicons' },
];
5. Now try
   Update your vite.config.js as above.
   Delete your dist folder.
   Run npm run build (or yarn build if you use yarn).
   You should find that your build now works, and the files are copied as intended!

If you want, paste your new vite.config.js here and I will double check it.

🎉 Awesome! Congratulations on getting your zipped extension built successfully!

You’ve now solved the Vite static copy issue and can build and package the extension as intended.

Next Steps
Per your instructions:

Help me modify this github to make it extract the information I want, and set it up to allow me to create a custom github repo based on the extraction.

If you want to customize what data is extracted (for example, extract only certain fields, or add new fields):

Let me know exactly what data you want to extract, filter, or modify from Audible! (e.g., only title + author, or add custom tags, etc.)
I’ll walk you through the changes (and where in the code) to do this.
If you want to make a template or tool to generate your own custom repo:

Say what kind of repo you want, and what the workflow should look like (for example: “I want a script that takes my JSON and creates a new repo with a custom gallery”).
Just tell me your goal for extraction or customization, and I’ll give you precise, step-by-step instructions!

You said: well, how do I install it in
well, how do I install it in my browser though?
Copilot said: Great question! Here’s how to install your
Great question! Here’s how to install your freshly zipped extension in your browser (Chrome/Edge or any Chromium-based browser):

1. Extract the ZIP
   Unzip the file you just built (for example, audible-library-extractor-0.2.12.zip) into a folder somewhere on your computer.
2. Open Extensions Page
   Go to chrome://extensions (for Chrome) or edge://extensions (for Edge).
   Turn on Developer mode (toggle in the top right).
3. Load the Unpacked Extension
   Click “Load unpacked”.
   Select the unzipped folder (the one containing manifest.json and all your files).
4. Done!
   The extension should now appear in your extensions list.
   Pin it if you want easy access.
   Go to your Audible library and test it out!
   Troubleshooting
   If you see errors, make sure you selected the unzipped folder (not the zip file itself).
   If you update your code, just hit the refresh button on the extension page to reload.
   Let me know if you want step-by-step instructions for Firefox or if you have any issues loading it!

You said: where did it save the zip
where did it save the zip
Copilot said: The zip file is saved in the
The zip file is saved in the root folder of your project (the same folder as your package.json, vite.config.js, etc.).

Given your project structure, after a successful build and zip, you should find a file named something like:

Code
audible-library-extractor-0.2.12.zip
right in:

Code
C:\Users\britt\WebstormProjects\ALE-Customize\
If you set a different project name or version in package.json, the filename will match that name and version.

Tip:
If you don't see it, try refreshing your file explorer or sorting by "Date Modified" to see the newest files at the top.

Let me know if you can't find it!

You said: okay it's extracted
okay it's extracted
Copilot said: Awesome! 🎉 Now that you’ve extracted
Awesome! 🎉
Now that you’ve extracted your Audible data with the extension, you can:

View and use your local gallery (the extension’s default output).
Customize what information is extracted.
Export it for use in a custom GitHub repo or another format.
