CURRENT SUMMARY OF UNDERSTANDING
-The Audible Library Extractor (“ALE-Customize”) uses a multi-step async “waterfall” extraction process
(see src/content-script/content-script-app.vue).
-Extraction steps (for library, wishlist, store pages, etc.) are managed as an array of functions, each passing results
to the next via callbacks, typically named done or callback.
-Each item (e.g., book) in a batch extraction is processed asynchronously. When an item’s extraction is complete,
its callback (done) is called. When all in the batch are done, the step’s callback is called to continue the waterfall.
-Stack traces may show multiple done functions called. The first usually marks the completion of an individual async task
(e.g., extraction for a single book), while the next may represent the completion of the entire batch, or step.
-The actual processing (fetching, parsing, mapping, etc.) for each book occurs between these done calls.
-The amapxios mixin is a utility for mapping over async axios requests, used throughout the extraction steps.
-To trace or modify data extraction, focus on the extraction step functions and how they use amapxios and their
respective done/callback logic.
