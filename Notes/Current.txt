Changes from original ALE
(in addition to what was required for me to package it)

8/25/25
1. Tried adding de-duplication to series-processing
    RESULT: Nothing changed
2. Added de-duplication to series in cleanup phase of content-script-app.vue
    RESULT: Success! No duplicate ASINs in series anymore!

8/24/25
1. Added getseriesdata to after getwishlistdata (after it's getstoredata) in src\content-script\content-script-app.vue
to fetch series data twice: after library book data retrieval and after wishlist book data retrieval.
    Result: nothing changed; plugin still worked, but no additional series data retrieved (or shown) in gallery.
2. Changed src\content-script\_components\_mixins\main-step\process-wishlist.js to save wishlist data to hotpotato.books instead of hotpotato.wishlist
because even though wishlist series data seems to be saved in the same place as library series, process-series-pages.js seems to be checking
series data against hotpotato.books and only processing series if a book appears in that file. Ony other thing added was to ensure
hotpotato.books was added to, not replaced, by wishlist data.  New possibility of duplicates was there but wanted to change things one by one
to isolate errors.
    Result: view at https://britastic365.github.io/Combined-Gallery1/#/library
             Successes:
             Actually accomplished a few things that I was trying to do, not just get more series data!
                -Wishlist books were added to library books data
                -The gallery display only shows the library page now, no wishlist at all
                -All wishlist books appear in library page, along with pricing information
                -Expanded series data was pulled (and is shown) for library and wishlist books, but in one series page, instead of separated
                -Wishlist books are only counted once in library gallery (so no duplicates shown there)
                -List of series correctly displays the number of books in the series that are actually in library/wishlist
             Problems:
                -Wishlist books are duplicated in SERIES information in book detail view; an example is:
                         Book Details Page - My Books in Series:
                         -Lists the correct series name, and the correct total number of books in the series, but incorrectly counts
                         the one book in the series (that's in the wishlist) twice, resulting in 2/3 books being counted as "my books"
                         -Lists 4 books in the series even though it correctly counts 3 total books in the series
                -Series Detail (when clicking on series in series table): Shows 2 rows for the same wishlist book.

Possible Next Step
-Examine the created gallery files to find out if the book is actually duplicated, or just being shown twice
in series for some reason.
    -Library.js: Wishlist series book only mentioned once.
    -Series.js: Wishlist books in series mentioned twice.
-Added deduplication to process-store-pages.js and process-series-pages.js and issue still happening.


Not entirely sure why this is happening. Maybe it something that needs to be fixed when the series data is being written; or a filter needs
to be added in the series information display. AI suggests looking deduplication logic for the main library view display and series view.

Copilot suggestion:
1. Main Library Display (Library Page)
Look for the code that renders the list of books.
This will likely be in a Vue component for the library/gallery, such as a file named something like:
src/gallery/_components/alePages/AleLibrary.vue
src/gallery/gallery-app.vue
Or a similar main Vue file responsible for the page with your book gallery.
What to search for:
Computed properties or functions that prepare the list of books for display.
Look for usage of _.uniqBy(books, 'asin'), .filter(), .map(), or similar.
Search for the word uniq or dedup or just asin in those files.
2. Series View
Look for the component that displays the series details.
This might be in a file like:
src/gallery/_components/alePages/AleSeries.vue
Or a similar file for the series detail/page/view.
Here too, check for any logic preparing the list of books in the series for display.
Search for code that filters hotpotato.books or your book array by series, and see if it deduplicates by ASIN.
3. How to Search
If using VS Code or similar, search the project for:
uniqBy
asin
dedup
books (and see where it's mapped or filtered for the library or series display)
4. What it will look like
Deduplicated:
js
const booksToShow = _.uniqBy(books, 'asin');
Not deduplicated:
js
const booksToShow = books.filter(...);
// but no uniqBy or similar
5. Based on your repoâ€™s structure
Your main gallery entrypoint is likely in src/gallery/gallery-app.vue or a component there.
Series logic may be in src/gallery/_components/alePages/AleSeries.vue or similar.
6. Summary
Look in the Vue files/components for the library and series pages.
Search for computed properties or methods that build the book arrays for display.
Check if they use _.uniqBy or similar deduplication on ASIN.
Add deduplication where it is missing (likely in the series display).
